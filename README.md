# 1000Genomes_data_indexes

This git repo has been setup to store and track READMEs, sequence index files and other data index files created for data from the 1000 Genomes Project.

Currently this repo is being used to track the sequence data generated for the Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium to assay three trios to establish a high quality SV map for each genome. Please note there are data reuse conditions which are associated with these indexes. These indexes and the data reuse conditions can be found in the [hgsv_sv_discovery](https://github.com/igsr/1000Genomes_data_indexes/tree/master/data_collections/hgsv_sv_discovery)

The structure of this repo should reflect the directory structure of the FTP site. New READMEs which get placed at the toplevel. Any index files and READMES associated with a particular data collection will belong in that [data collection's directory](https://github.com/igsr/1000Genomes_data_indexes/tree/master/). Any data reuse statements which belong to a particular data collection will be found in that data collection's directory

Currently we have the following data collections

hgsv_sv_discovery - This represents the ongoing work from the 1000 Genomes Structural Variation group who aim to produce high quality SV catalogues for three trios of individuals  
simons_diversity_data - This represents the data from the [Simons's Diversity Project](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/simons-genome-diversity-project/)
