###HGDP-CEPH

The Fondation Jean Dausset - Centre d'Étude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) maintains the bank of cell lines that form the HGDP-CEPH Human Genome Diversity Cell Line Panel. Further information is available from the [website of the Fondation Jean Dausset](http://www.cephb.fr/en/hgdp_panel.php), including [information on conditions of access and use](http://www.cephb.fr/en/hgdp_panel.php#conditionsacces).

The HGDP-CEPH panel is composed of 1063 LCLs, from 1050 individuals from 52 populations.

###Sequence data

The [Tyler-Smith group](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/groups/tyler-smith-group) at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI) have generated high-coverage Illumina sequence data from these samples. Information on using this data can be found on the [WTSI website](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/datasharing/).

###Samples in the HGDP collection

Please note that some of the samples present in the HGDP collection are also present in the [Simons diversity](https://github.com/igsr/1000Genomes_data_indexes/blob/master/data_collections/simons_diversity_data/README_Simons_diversity_data.md) collection.
