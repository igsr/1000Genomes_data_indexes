#Simons Diversity Project

This collection contains data from the [Simons Genome Diversity Project](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/simons-genome-diversity-project/).

**Please respect [Fort Lauderdale Principles](https://www.genome.gov/pages/research/wellcomereport0303.pdf) and see the [accompanying Data Reuse policy](https://github.com/igsr/1000Genomes_data_indexes/blob/master/data_collections/simons_diversity_data/README_Simons_diversity_datareuse_statement.md) with regard to this data.**

###About the Simons Genome Diversity Project

Information about the project is available on the [Simons Foundation website](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/life-sciences/simons-genome-diversity-project-dataset/):

"The sampling strategy differs from studies of human genome diversity that have aimed to maximize medical relevance by studying populations with large numbers of present-day people. This new study takes a different approach by sampling populations in a way that represents as much anthropological, linguistic and cultural diversity as possible, and thus includes many deeply divergent human populations that are not well represented in other datasets."

The genomes were sequenced to at least 30x coverage using Illumina technology at Harvard Medical School. Contacts there regarding the data are: Shop Mallick (shop@genetics.med.harvard.edu), Nick Patterson (nickp@broadinstitute.org) or David Reich (reich@genetics.med.harvard.edu).

###Samples in the Simons Diversity Project

Please note that some of the samples included in the Simons Diversity Project are also present in either the [1000 Genomes Project](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/1000_genomes_project/) or the [HGDP](https://github.com/igsr/1000Genomes_data_indexes/blob/master/data_collections/HGDP/README_HGDP.md) collections.
