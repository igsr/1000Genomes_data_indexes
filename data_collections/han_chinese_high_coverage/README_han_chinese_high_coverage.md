#Han Chinese high coverage

This collection contains data relating to 90 Han Chinese genomes, which have been sequenced at high coverage by Lan et al. These samples were collected by the 1000 Genomes Project and include individuals from the CHS and CHB populations of the 1000 Genomes Project. Further details can be found in the [Gigascience publication](https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/gix067) which describes this sequence data.

**Please see the accompanying Data Reuse policy with regard to this data and cite the publication mentioned above. Details of the Data Reuse policy can be found in [README_han_chinese_high_coverage_datareuse_statement.md](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/han_chinese_high_coverage/README_han_chinese_high_coverage_datareuse_statement.md).**

###Cell lines

As mentioned, the sequence data in this collection is from cell lines generated from samples collected by the 1000 Genomes Project. These cell lines are available from the Coriell institute.

###Sequence data

The sequnce data in this collection was generated at [BGI](http://www.genomics.cn/en/index). Sequence data was generated at high-coverage and with an assortment of insert sizes.

###Samples in the 1000 Genomes collection

Please note that most of the samples present in the Han Chinese collection are also present in the [1000 Genomes GRCh38 collection](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/1000_genomes_project/).
